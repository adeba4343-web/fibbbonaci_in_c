# fibbbonaci_in_c
Fibonacci series using both recursive and iterative approaches in C. 

A fibonacci series is a series of number where each number is the sum of two preceding terms.

This repository demonstrates Fibonacci series generation in C using:

- Iterative approach
- Recursive approach

##COMPARISON
|Approach   | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Notes               |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Iterative | O(n)            | O(1)             | Efficient           |
| Recursive | O(2^n)          | O(n)             | Easy to understand  |
